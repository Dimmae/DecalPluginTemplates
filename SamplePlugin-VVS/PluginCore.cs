 * Created by Mag-nus. 8/19/2011, VVS added by Virindi-Inquisitor.
 * 
 * No license applied, feel free to use as you wish. H4CK TH3 PL4N3T? TR45H1NG 0UR R1GHT5? Y0U D3C1D3!
 * 
 * Notice how I use try/catch on every function that is called or raised by decal (by base events or user initiated events like buttons, etc...).
 * This is very important. Don't crash out your users!
 * 
 * In 2.9.6.4+ Host and Core both have Actions objects in them. They are essentially the same thing.
 * You sould use Host.Actions though so that your code compiles against 2.9.6.0 (even though I reference 2.9.6.5 in this project)
 * 
 * If you add this plugin to decal and then also create another plugin off of this sample, you will need to change the guid in
 * Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs to have both plugins in decal at the same time.
 * 
 * If you have issues compiling, remove the Decal.Adapater and VirindiViewService references and add the ones you have locally.
 * Decal.Adapter should be in C:\Games\Decal 3.0\
 * VirindiViewService should be in C:\Games\VirindiPlugins\VirindiViewService\
